The **ZigBee cluster library** in `no_std` defines a set of standard commands and behaviors used for communication between
devices within a Zigbee network.

Zigbee is a wireless communication technology designed for low-power devices in smart homes and industrial settings. 

This library enables the interoperability among devices within a Zigbee network, allowing them to communicate and 
perform specific functions based on the defined clusters. 
These clusters represent various device capabilities such as lighting control, sensor data collection, and home automation.
